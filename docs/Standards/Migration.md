Projects that are not currently using the EC standard can be migrated to use it in a handful of checks.

## Structure

Your directory structure should match what is described in the [structure page](./Structure.md)

## Vault
All your vaulted files should be fully encrypted according to the [vault rules](./Vault.md#rules)
